# PyLine 

An *on-the-go* terminal based IDE made for testing on
***<u>all scales</u>***.

## Features

PyLine can be thought of a more IDE-like version of the python console.
And so, logically, it has all the functions of it, which include:

- Immediate expression execution
- Functions
- Variables

And, as an expansion, it also comes with some nice extra features:

- Post creation function editing
- Function and variable saving
- Function and variable sets

# In the future
